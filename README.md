I chose to use the pyfiglet library to create this logo. The pyfiglet library allows for the generation of text-based art using various fonts and styles, making it an ideal choice for creating an engaging and visually appealing logo in a command-line environment. Its ease of use and flexibility in rendering ASCII art made it the perfect tool for achieving the desired look and feel for the Word Rescue logo.

I chose to use Lucidchart for creating the flowchart because it made it easy to visually map out the logical flow of the game. Its intuitive interface allowed me to quickly organize and present the game's structure in a clear manner, helping to ensure that all steps and decision points are easily understandable.
